<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This is the webpage of the Malicious SHA-1 project, a research project that demonstrates how the security of the SHA-1 hashing standard can be <strong>fully compromised</strong> if one slightly tweaks some of the predefined constants in the SHA-1 algorithm. That is, we show that applications using “custom” versions of SHA-1 may include backdoors exploitable by the application designers (and only them). Such “custom” versions are typically found in proprietary systems as a way to personalize the cryptography for a given customer, while retaining the security guarantees of the original algorithm.</p>
<p>The colliding messages constructed can be valid archives files (RAR or 7zip) such that the content of the two archives can be fully controlled. We also build colliding JPEG files, which can be any two images, as in the example below (images were chosen at random):</p>
<img src="img/collision.png" width=500/>
<p>We can also construct <strong>colliding executables</strong>, which MBR (Master Boot Record) or COM files including arbitrary code. Furthermore, we present <strong>polyglot</strong> malicious SHA-1 instances, that is, for which the designer can create colliding files of different types with arbitrary content (for example: any two MBR’s, any two RAR archives, and any two shell scripts)</p>
<p>The Malicious SHA-1 project was presented in 2014 at the following security and cryptography conferences:</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The security of a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1 relies on the practical impossibility of finding collisions, that is, distinct messages having the same hash value. Denoting the hash function <em>H</em>, a collision is thus a pair of distinct messages—not necessarily of same length—M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> such that <em>H</em>(M<sub>1</sub>) = <em>H</em>(M<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<h3 id="sha-1">SHA-1</h3>
<p>SHA-1 is a NIST standard, designed by NSA in 1995, and used everywhere: in TLS, SSH, IPsec, etc. as part of encryption, signature, message authentication, or key derivation schemes.</p>
<p>SHA-1 produces 160-bit hash values. Therefore a generic attack requires approximately 2<sup>80</sup> evaluations of SHA-1 to find a collision, as per the birthday paradox. Such a “birthday attack” works on any reasonable hash function regardless of its strength. Cryptographers thus say that a hash function is “broken” if one finds an attack substantially faster than the birthday attack.</p>
<p>According to this definition, <strong>SHA-1 is broken</strong>, since public research described collision attacks more than a thousand times faster than the birthday attack. However,</p>
<ul>
<li>the actual complexity is unclear, but seems to be greater than 2<sup>60</sup></li>
<li>an actual collision has yet to be published</li>
</ul>
<p>SHA-1 processes message by compressing iteratively blocks of 512 bits.</p>
<p>The known collision attacks are <strong>differential attacks</strong>. These introduce differences in the first message block, and control the propagation of the differences thereby injected in SHA-1’s internal state in order to “correct” the disturbances thanks to a second message block and thus finally obtain a collision—an internal state now free of any difference.</p>
<h3 id="backdooring">Backdooring</h3>
<p>To construct malicious SHA-1 versions, we had to find</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a differential characteristic of high enough probability (that is, a pattern of differences propagation that leads to a collision)</li>
<li>a method to efficiently find messages and constants following this characteristic</li>
</ol>
<p>To find a differential characteristic, we build on previous research and sought a characteristic by linearization that minimizes the cost of construction a malicious version of SHA-1.</p>
<p>The full characteristic used looks as follows, where we noted its respective probabilities for each of the four 20-step rounds:</p>
<img src="img/diff.png" width=700/>
<p>The constants modified are the 32-bit values K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>, K<sub>3</sub>, and K<sub>4</sub>, which are injected in steps 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, and 61-80, respectively. The arithmetic operations of SHA-1 are <strong>not modified</strong>, and the malicious versions are <strong>as strong as the original SHA-1</strong> (unless one knows the backdoor).</p>
<p>The construction of a malicious SHA-1 then consists in</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>selecting a message block, where a first subset of the block is fixed and a second subset will be modified</li>
<li>modifying the second subset of the message block and the constants such that the differential characteristic is followed, yielding a collision</li>
</ol>
<p>The exact number of differences in the constant varies with the malicious SHA-1 constructed, and on average is 40 bits of the 128-bit constants.</p>
<p>An example of collision is:</p>
<p>K<sub>1..4</sub> = <code> 5a827999 4eb9d7f7 bad18e2f d79e5877</code></p>
<p>M<sub>1</sub> = <code>ffd8ffe1 e2001250 b6cef608 34f4fe83 ffae884f afe56e6f fc50fae6 28c40f81 1b1d3283 b48c11bc b1d4b511 a976cb20 a7a929f0 2327f9bb ecde01c0 7dc00852</code></p>
<p>M<sub>2</sub> = <code>ffd8ffe2 c2001224 3ecef608 dcf4fee1 37ae880c 87e56e6b bc50faa4 60c40fc7 931d3281 b48c11a8 b9d4b513 0976cb74 2fa929f2 a327f9bb 44de01c3 d5c00832</code></p>
<p><em>H</em>(M<sub>1</sub>) = <em>H</em>(M<sub>2</sub>) = <code>1896b202 394b0aae 54526cfa e72ec5f2 42b1837e</code></p>
<p>Contrary to theoretical attacks on the original SHA-1, our method find collisions between two <strong>1-block messages</strong>, rather than 2-block messages.</p>
<h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3>
<p>Our basic idea to exploit our generator of malicious SHA-1’s is depicted below, where the message block M<sub>x</sub> instructs the processor unit (archive extractor, image viewer, CPU, shell interpreter, etc.) to process Payload<sub>x</sub>:</p>
<img src="img/payload.png" width=500/>
<p>This is not straightforward, due to the constraints imposed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>by the <strong>differential characteristics</strong>: differences (only) in the first block at predefined positions</p></li>
<li><p>by the <strong>file formats</strong>: 4-byte “magic” signatures at offset 0 are corrupted by the differences of the characteristic used</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The constraints prevent us from finding colliding binaries for the common operating systems: PE (Windows), ELF (Linux), Mach-O (Mac).</p>
<p>However, a number of other formats are more flexible. A straightforward example is that of two colliding shell scripts, where differences are in the commented garbage, and the subsequent bytes express a condition relative to the value of those bytes:</p>
<img src="img/shell.png" width=700/>
<p>Note that in the above shell script, we could have included any statements inside the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>.</p>
<p>We also produced colliding files of the following file formats: <strong>RAR and 7zip archives</strong> (requiring a 4-byte signature, however this doesn’t need be at offset 0) and <strong>Master Boot Records and COM executables</strong> (which don’t require a signature and can directly start with actual code).</p>
<p>Combining all the trick used with additional ones, we created <strong>polyglot</strong> malicious SHA-1 instances, by relying on a first block that is valid with respect to different file formats. For example, we constructed a malicious SHA-1 instance for which we can build colliding files for any two payloads of MBR executables, RAR archives, or shell scripts:</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-implications-for-sha-1s-security">What are the implications for SHA-1’s security?</h3>
<p>None.</p>
<p>The differential cryptanalysis techniques used to find our collisions are inspired and derived from the best known attacks on the original SHA-1, and do not lead to improved attacks on SHA-1 (as far as we can tell).</p>
<h3 id="did-nsa-use-this-trick-when-creating-sha-1-in-1995">Did NSA use this trick when creating SHA-1 in 1995?</h3>
<p>We believe this is unlikely, for</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Our results rely on state-of-the-art differential cryptanalysis research, as of 2014, based on techniques that were only publicly developed since around 2004</p></li>
<li><p>Just before SHA-1, NSA designed SHA-0, for which weaknesses were quickly identified by the research community and actual collisions presented later, in 1998; this negligence does not suggest extraordinary cryptanalysis abilities from NSA back then</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="can-you-do-the-same-for-sha-256">Can you do the same for SHA-256?</h3>
<p>Not at the moment.</p>
<p>SHA-256 is a much different case, for</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>SHA-256 uses 64 distinct constants for each of its 64 steps, whereas SHA-1 uses 4 distinct constants for each 20-step “round” of its 80-step construction. This provides much more freedom to sabotage the algorithm, however this will likely imply many more differences (in terms of Hamming weight) than in the case of SHA-1.</p></li>
<li><p>Whereas theoretical attacks are known on the full, 80-step, SHA-1, the best known collision attacks on SHA-256 are on <a href="TBD">31 steps only</a>, of 64 steps in total. It may thus be difficult to find a 64-step characteristics exploitable to build a malicious SHA-256.</p></li>
