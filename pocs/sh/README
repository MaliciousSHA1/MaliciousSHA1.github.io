A collision for malicious SHA-1
created by Maria Eichlseder & Malicious SHA-1 project

eve1.sh and eve2.sh are bash shell scripts

with the common hash value
96ED59BE 04518A27 C30F17DE 6F0037F9 B3C3257E

for SHA-1 with the following modified round constants:
K0 = 5A827999
K1 = 88E8EA68
K2 = 578059DE
K3 = 54324A39

test with 'python2 ../sha1mod.py eve1.sh 5A827999 88E8EA68 578059DE 54324A39' etc
